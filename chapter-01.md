Exercise solutions from chapter 1 in the book Javascript from Beginner to Professional.

## Practice Exercise 1.1

### Part 1

Opened the browser console in Google Chrome Browser running on a Windows computer using the function key `F12`. Then typed `4 + 10` in the console followed by pressing the `Enter` key. The result was that `14` was presented in the console. This means that the console is able to perform arithmetic calculations.

### Part 2

Tested the statement `console.log("Henrik")` in the same console as in part 1 above. The result was that my name, Henrik, was presented as output in the console. This means that this statement can be used to debug while developing web pages.
